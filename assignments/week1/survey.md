# Class Survey

1. What is your name? Hana Batio

2. What is your bu-id? U99744250

3. What programming languages do you know? Python, Java, C

4. Do you have any particular interests in CS that you intend to pursue (e.g, machine learning, security, software development, etc.)? Software development, machine learning

5. For the programming language that you use the most, what do you like MOST about the language? I find Java very readable and easy to understand because you must lay out and define everything. In other words, I like that it is very structured.

6. For the programming language that you use the most, what do you like LEAST about the language? Even though I like the structure, you have to write a lot of code to perform even simple tasks, which can be annoying sometimes.

7. What would you like to learn from this class? From our introductory lecture, it seems like Haskell will provide some interesting contrasts with Java. It seems to be less structured than Java but also able to achieve an end goal using less code. So, I am very itnerested to learn more about Haskell and compare and contrast it with the other languages that I already know. Additionally, I am excited for the final project.
